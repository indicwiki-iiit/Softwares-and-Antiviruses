# Softwares-and-Antiviruses

It is one of the domains of the indicwiki project

# Description

The outcome of this domain was to collect data and articulate the information about various antiviruses and softwares for wikipedia. There are numerous softwares which are currently in use, although there was no particular website which describes the information in a native language (i.e Telugu). Therefore we took up the task to generate the essay’s for about 11500 softwares and nearly 100 antiviruses. Furthermore, we’ve used python at each and every stage of the process(i.e scrapping,cleaning,merging) apart from that we’ve used few libraries to translate and transliterate the data (i.e anuvad,deep translit).
